## What Is FluxCD?
FluxCD is a popular GitOps tool that helps automate the deployment and management of applications in Kubernetes.

## FluxCD Toolkit Components
When we install fluxCD a set of controllers installed in our cluster.
it consists of four main components: 
- Source Controller
- Helm Controller
- Kustomize Controller
- Notification Controller

### Flux Helm Controller:

- Purpose: Manages Helm releases in your Kubernetes clusters.
- How it works: Flux Helm Controller watches your Helm chart repositories and releases, and ensures that the deployed releases match the desired state defined in your Git repository.
- Usage: You can use Helm charts to define your application's configurations, dependencies, and deployment details. 

  The Helm Controller ensures that the Helm releases in your clusters stay in sync with the Helm charts stored in your Git repository.

### Flux Source Controller:

- Purpose: Manages the deployment of applications based on source code changes.
- How it works: Flux Source Controller monitors your source code repositories (e.g., Git repositories) for changes. When changes are detected, it triggers a deployment pipeline to update the Kubernetes cluster with the latest version of the application.
- Usage: Source Controller enables continuous deployment by automatically triggering updates to your Kubernetes clusters when changes are pushed to the specified branches or repositories.

### Flux Kustomize Controller:

- Purpose: Manages applications defined using Kustomize.
- How it works: Flux Kustomize Controller watches your Git repositories for changes to Kustomization files. When changes are detected, it applies the Kustomize configurations to update the state of the applications in your Kubernetes clusters.
- Usage: Kustomize allows you to define and customize Kubernetes manifests using overlay files. The Kustomize Controller ensures that the applications' states in the clusters match the desired states defined in your Git repositories.

The typical flow in a FluxCD workflow involves storing your application configurations, including Helm charts, Kustomize configurations, or other manifest files, in a Git repository. The Flux controllers continuously monitor this repository for changes and automatically apply those changes to your Kubernetes clusters.

### Here's a simplified flow:

#### Configure your application:

Store your application configurations in a Git repository.
For Helm charts, you might store them in a Helm chart repository.
For Kustomize, you would use Kustomization files.

#### GitOps Automation:

FluxCD controllers continuously watch the Git repository for changes.
When changes are detected, the corresponding controller (Helm, Source, or Kustomize) triggers the necessary actions to synchronize the Kubernetes clusters with the updated configurations.

#### Continuous Deployment:

Changes to source code can trigger Source Controller to initiate a deployment pipeline.
Helm Controller and Kustomize Controller ensure that Helm releases and Kustomize applications are updated accordingly.

#### Desired State Synchronization:

The FluxCD controllers maintain the desired state of applications in the clusters, based on the configurations stored in the Git repository.
By using FluxCD controllers, you can practice GitOps principles, where the desired state of your infrastructure and applications is declared in version-controlled repositories, and automation ensures that the actual state of the system converges to the desired state.
