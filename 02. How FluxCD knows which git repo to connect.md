## How FluxCD knows which git repo to connect 

In FluxCD, the Git repository information is typically provided through the GitRepository custom resource (CR). 
The GitRepository CR specifies the details of the Git repository that FluxCD should monitor for changes. Here is an example of a GitRepository custom resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: my-git-repo
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 5m
  url: https://github.com/your-username/your-repository
  ref:
    branch: main
```
This GitRepository resource needs to be applied to your Kubernetes cluster, typically within the flux-system namespace. Once applied, 
FluxCD will automatically start watching the specified Git repository for changes.

Make sure to customize the url and ref fields according to your Git repository's URL and the branch or tag you want FluxCD to track.

After setting up the GitRepository, FluxCD will reconcile with the specified Git repository at the defined interval, detect changes, 
and synchronize the desired state with your Kubernetes cluster based on the contents of the Git repository.

## Usage Example: 
Let's say we wanted to deploy this https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo to our cluster.
Any changes in the repo should be monitored and deployed by FluxCD to our cluster. How to achieve this ?

### Part1: Detect changes in another git repo
ðŸ‘‰ Define a GitRepository custom resource for FluxCD. This resource is used by FluxCD to configure how it interacts with a Git repository.

```yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 30s
  ref:
    branch: master
  url: https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo
```
- FluxCD will watch the podinfo GitRepository in the flux-system namespace.
- Every 30 seconds, FluxCD will check the specified Git repository (https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo) for changes on the master branch.
- If changes are detected, FluxCD will trigger a reconciliation process, syncing the changes from the Git repository to the Kubernetes cluster.
- The changes may include updates to Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, or other configurations stored in the specified Git repository.
- This GitRepository resource essentially tells FluxCD where to look for the source of truth for your Kubernetes configurations. It's a key component in the GitOps workflow

### Part2: What to do when change is detected
Define a Kustomization custom resource for FluxCD. This resource, in combination with the previously provided GitRepository resource, sets up a FluxCD configuration to manage Kubernetes resources using Kustomize.

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 5m0s
  path: ./kustomize
  prune: true
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: podinfo
    targetNamespace: default
```
- FluxCD will watch the podinfo Kustomization in the flux-system namespace.
- Every 5 minutes, FluxCD will check the specified Git repository (https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo) for changes in the ./kustomize path.
- It includes details such as the path (./kustomize) within the Git repository where Kustomization files are located.
- If changes are detected, FluxCD will trigger a reconciliation process, syncing the changes from the Kustomization directory to the Kubernetes cluster.
- The Kustomization files in the specified path may include overlays, patches, or other Kustomize-specific configurations to customize and deploy Kubernetes resources.
